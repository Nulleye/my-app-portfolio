**Udacity Android nDegree - Project 0**

This project is part of the Udacity Android online Nano-Degree co-created by Google.

It's the first project and consists of a simple view with buttons that will launch all the projects made in this Nano-Degree.

It has been built from scratch and requires the course **How to Install Android Studio**.

## TO-DO

Linking all projects to main view buttons is still pending.
